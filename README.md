Yelp in real time. HoppScotch allows you to find out in real time how people are rating a bar or restaurant. You can see from the heat map where ratings are available. Users can also contribute to the ratings by checking in to the bar or restaurant they are at. The app will automatically allow a user to rate a location based on their gps. This ensures only people physically at a place can rate it, and participate in the chat room.
